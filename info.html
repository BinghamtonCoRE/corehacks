                                <span class="question">What is a hackathon?</span><br />

                                Great question! A hackathon is best described as an "invention marathon". Anyone who has an interest in technology [or completing their CoRE projects in CoREhacks' case] attends a hackathon to learn, build and share their creations over the course of a weekend in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. You don’t have to be a programmer and you certainly don’t have to be majoring in CS.

                                <br /><br /><span class="question">When does registration close?</span><br />

                                The Friday of the day of the event. There's also nothing stopping you from entering the CoRE Lounge, since you are in CoRE.

                                <br /><br /><span class="question">When will I know if I got in?</span><br />

                                At the same time you choose to willingly participate and show up.

                                <br /><br /><span class="question">How old do you need to be to attend CoREhacks?</span><br />

                                Old enough to be living on CoRE. You should also be in CoRE.

                                <br /><br /><span class="question">How much does this cost?</span><br />

                                The CoREhacks Team? Probably something above zero. You? Zero.

                                <br /><br /><span class="question">I've never been to a hackathon before, can I still apply?</span><br />

                                Of course you can! Our attendees will range from first-timers to veteran hackers. Saddle up to a new framework, refresh a stale project, or just hang out and enjoy the company you've always had.

                                <br /><br /><span class="question">I don't live near Binghamton University - can I still come?</span><br />

                                Probably not, because then you don't live in CoRE.

                                <br /><br /><span class="question">How am I supposed to get there?</span><br />

                                If you live on the floor, you’re good to go.

                                <br /><br /><span class="question">Are buses being provided?</span><br />

                                Buses will be provided out of courtesy to all attendees. You may check the schedules <a href="https://occtransport.org/index.php/schedule">here</a> for the best route to the community.

                                <br /><br /><span class="question">Can high schoolers join?</span><br />

                                Unfotunately, we cannot accept high schoolers due to liability issues and the fact that there are no high schoolers in CoRE. This is a CoRE internal hackathon after all.

                                <br /><br /><span class="question">My question isn't answered here.</span><br />

                                Sucks to be you.

                                <br /><br /><span class="question">No, seriously. I have a question not listed here. Who do I ask?</span><br />

                                Oh, in that case, talk to Gabe, Taylor, or Alan. Why didn't you say so sooner? This is a FAQ. That wasn't a question.
